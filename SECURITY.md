# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for receiving such patches depends on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The security of this project is taken seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT disclose publicly

Please do **NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities. This helps ensure that vulnerabilities are not exploited before they can be addressed.

### 2. Report privately

Report security vulnerabilities by emailing the project security team at:

```
security@[your-organization].com
```

Please include the following information:

- Type of vulnerability (e.g., encryption bypass, access control weakness)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact assessment and potential attack scenarios
- Any potential mitigation you've identified

### 3. Response timeline

- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours
- **Vulnerability confirmation**: Within 5 business days
- **Patch development**: Based on severity (see below)
- **Public disclosure**: Coordinated after patch release

### 4. Severity levels and response times

| Severity | CVSS Score | Response Time | Example |
|----------|------------|---------------|---------|
| Critical | 9.0-10.0 | 24 hours | Encryption bypass allowing PHI exposure |
| High | 7.0-8.9 | 72 hours | Access control weakness |
| Medium | 4.0-6.9 | 1 week | Configuration issues |
| Low | 0.1-3.9 | 2 weeks | Best practice violations |

## Security Considerations for PHI Storage

This module is designed for storing Protected Health Information (PHI) in compliance with HIPAA requirements. When using this module:

### Encryption

- **At Rest**: All data is encrypted using AWS KMS with customer-managed keys
- **In Transit**: SSL/TLS is enforced for all connections
- **Key Rotation**: Automatic key rotation is enabled by default

### Access Control

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Use S3 Access Points to grant minimal required permissions
- **MFA Delete**: Enable MFA delete in production environments
- **IAM Policies**: Review and audit IAM policies regularly

### Monitoring

- **CloudTrail**: All API calls are logged
- **EventBridge**: Real-time alerts for security events
- **Security Hub**: Continuous compliance monitoring

### Data Protection

- **Versioning**: Enabled by default for data recovery
- **Replication**: Cross-region replication for disaster recovery
- **Lifecycle Policies**: Automated data retention management

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Pre-deployment

- [ ] Review all Terraform variables and ensure secure defaults
- [ ] Enable pre-commit hooks for security scanning
- [ ] Run security scans (tfsec, checkov, terrascan)
- [ ] Review IAM policies and access patterns

### 2. Deployment

- [ ] Use a secure backend for Terraform state (encrypted S3 + DynamoDB)
- [ ] Enable detailed CloudTrail logging
- [ ] Configure Security Hub for compliance monitoring
- [ ] Set up SNS notifications for security events

### 3. Post-deployment

- [ ] Regular security audits (monthly)
- [ ] Review access logs and patterns
- [ ] Update to latest module versions
- [ ] Monitor Security Hub findings
- [ ] Test disaster recovery procedures

### 4. Incident Response

1. **Detect**: Monitor CloudWatch alarms and Security Hub findings
2. **Contain**: Use S3 Access Points to quickly revoke access
3. **Investigate**: Review CloudTrail logs and access patterns
4. **Remediate**: Apply patches and update configurations
5. **Document**: Record lessons learned and update procedures

## Compliance Requirements

This module implements controls for the following compliance frameworks:

### HIPAA Security Rule

- **Administrative Safeguards** (45 CFR ยง164.308)
  - Access management through IAM and S3 Access Points
  - Security incident procedures via EventBridge
  - Contingency plan through replication

- **Physical Safeguards** (45 CFR ยง164.310)
  - AWS handles physical security of data centers
  - Encryption protects data on physical media

- **Technical Safeguards** (45 CFR ยง164.312)
  - Access control via IAM policies
  - Audit controls through CloudTrail
  - Integrity via versioning
  - Transmission security via SSL/TLS

### AWS Security Best Practices

- AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar
- CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark
- AWS Foundational Security Best Practices

## Security Tools Integration

### Pre-commit Hooks

```bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit

# Install hooks
pre-commit install

# Run manually
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Security Scanning

```bash
# TFSec
tfsec . --config-file=.tfsec.yml

# Checkov
checkov -d . --framework terraform

# Terrascan

```

### Continuous Monitoring

- **AWS Security Hub**: Aggregates findings from multiple services
- **Amazon GuardDuty**: Threat detection for S3
- **Amazon Macie**: PHI discovery and classification
- **AWS Config**: Compliance rule evaluation
