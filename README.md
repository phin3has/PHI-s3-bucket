- **CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark v1.2.0**: ‚úì Enabled

## Architecture Decision Records

### ADR-001: Multi-Region Replication Strategy

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: PHI data requires high availability and disaster recovery capabilities to meet HIPAA requirements for data availability and contingency planning.

**Decision**: Implement automated cross-region replication to a secondary region with:
- Same-region replication for operational recovery
- Cross-region replication for disaster recovery
- 15-minute RPO target
- Encrypted replication using separate KMS keys

**Consequences**: 
- Increased storage costs (mitigated by lifecycle policies)
- Enhanced data durability and availability
- Compliance with HIPAA contingency planning requirements

### ADR-002: Encryption Strategy

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: HIPAA requires encryption of PHI at rest and in transit.

**Decision**: Use customer-managed KMS keys with:
- Automatic key rotation enabled
- Separate keys for primary and replica regions
- Bucket key enabled for performance
- SSL/TLS enforced via bucket policy

**Consequences**:
- Full control over encryption keys
- Audit trail of key usage
- Slight performance overhead (mitigated by bucket keys)

### ADR-003: Access Control Model

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Different teams and applications need varying levels of access to PHI data.

**Decision**: Implement S3 Access Points for granular access control:
- VPC-restricted access points for internal services
- Separate access points per use case
- Policy-based access control
- No direct bucket access

**Consequences**:
- Simplified permission management
- Better security isolation
- Easier audit and compliance

### ADR-004: Cost Optimization Approach

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Healthcare data grows continuously, requiring cost management strategies.

**Decision**: Implement automated cost optimization:
- Intelligent-Tiering for automatic storage class transitions
- Lifecycle policies for predictable access patterns
- Archive to Glacier after 90 days
- Delete non-current versions after 2 years

**Consequences**:
- Reduced storage costs (up to 70% for archived data)
- Automated management reduces operational overhead
- Maintains compliance while optimizing costs

### ADR-005: Security Monitoring Strategy

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: HIPAA requires monitoring and alerting for security incidents.

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive monitoring stack:
- EventBridge for real-time event processing
- Security Hub for centralized findings
- GuardDuty for threat detection
- Macie for data classification

**Consequences**:
- Proactive security incident detection
- Automated compliance checking
- Centralized security visibility

   - Check encryption headers are included
   - Validate IAM permissions

3. **High Costs**
   - Review lifecycle policies
   - Check Intelligent-Tiering recommendations
   - Analyze access patterns with S3 Analytics

4. **Compliance Findings**
   - Review Security Hub findings
   - Check Config rule compliance
   - Validate all security features are enabled
